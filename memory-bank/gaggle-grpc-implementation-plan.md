# Gaggle gRPC Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive multi-phase plan to restore Goose Gaggle (distributed load testing) functionality using gRPC/Tonic, based on the detailed analysis and requirements from [Issue #645](https://github.com/tag1consulting/goose/issues/645).

## Background and Context

### Current State Analysis
- **Gaggle functionality completely removed from Goose** (no longer available)
- Users needing distributed testing must use alternative tools or older Goose versions
- Clean slate implementation opportunity with modern technology

### Business Impact
- Users cannot perform distributed load testing with current Goose
- Goose lacks competitive distributed testing capabilities
- Market opportunity to restore this functionality with modern implementation

## Solution: gRPC/Tonic Implementation

**gRPC/Tonic** was selected as the replacement solution for the following reasons:

1. **Architectural Alignment**: Manager-Worker pattern maps directly to gRPC client-server
2. **Performance**: Binary protocol buffers significantly more efficient than JSON/CBOR
3. **Production Ready**: Battle-tested in distributed systems at scale
4. **Ecosystem Maturity**: Excellent Rust support through Tonic
5. **Maintainability**: Industry-standard patterns, code generation
6. **Security**: Built-in TLS, authentication, health checking

## Functional Requirements (From Issue #645)

### Core Functionality
- [x] **Manager Mode**: Coordinate multiple workers, aggregate metrics
- [x] **Worker Mode**: Execute load tests, stream metrics to manager
- [x] **Binary Validation**: Hash-based verification of identical test plans
- [x] **Real-time Metrics**: Continuous metric aggregation during test execution
- [x] **Failure Recovery**: Handle worker disconnections gracefully
- [x] **Configuration Compatibility**: Restore CLI flags and configuration options
- [x] **Performance Parity**: No regression from nng-based implementation

### Success Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
- [ ] Manager can coordinate multiple workers
- [ ] Workers stream metrics in real-time

**Goal**: Establish gRPC infrastructure and protocol

#### Technical Architecture (Enhanced from Issue #645)
```
Manager (gRPC Server)
├── WorkerService
│   ├── RegisterWorker(WorkerInfo) -> WorkerId
│   ├── CommandStream(stream WorkerState) -> stream ManagerCommand
│   └── SubmitMetrics(stream MetricsBatch) -> MetricsResponse
└── Health Service (built-in)

Workers (gRPC Clients)
├── Connect and register with Manager
├── Maintain bi-directional command stream
├── Execute load test based on received configuration
└── Stream metrics continuously
```

#### Deliverables:

    rpc RegisterWorker(WorkerRegistration) returns (ManagerInformation);
    rpc SubmitMetrics(stream MetricsBatch) returns (MetricsResponse);
    rpc CommandStream(stream WorkerState) returns (stream ManagerCommand);
  }
  
  message WorkerRegistration {
    string worker_id = 1;
    string hostname = 2;
    string binary_hash = 3;     // For compatibility validation
    uint64 available_cpus = 4;
  }
  
  message ManagerCommand {
    oneof command {
      StartTest start = 1;
      StopTest stop = 2;
      UpdateUsers update_users = 3;
    }
  }
  ```

## Architecture Decisions and Rationale

### Communication Pattern: Bidirectional Streaming
**Decision**: Use bidirectional gRPC streams for real-time coordination
**Rationale**:
- Manager can push control commands instantly
- Workers stream metrics continuously without polling
- Lower latency than request-response patterns
- Natural backpressure handling

### State Management: Manager Authoritative
**Decision**: Manager holds authoritative state, workers are stateless
**Rationale**:
- Simplifies failure recovery (workers restart cleanly)
- Enables dynamic worker scaling
- Centralized decision making for load balancing
- Easier debugging and monitoring

### Protocol Versioning: Forward Compatibility
**Decision**: Versioned protocol buffers starting with `gaggle.v1`
**Rationale**:
- Future protocol changes won't break existing deployments
- Enables gradual migration strategies
- Standard industry practice for evolving APIs

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks
1. **gRPC Learning Curve**: Mitigate with team training and prototyping
2. **Performance Regression**: Early benchmarking and continuous monitoring
3. **Network Reliability**: Robust retry logic and connection management
4. **State Synchronization**: Careful design and comprehensive testing

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Maintain focus on core distributed testing functionality
2. **Over-engineering**: Avoid unnecessary complexity in initial implementation
3. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Identify and address scaling issues early
4. **Community Adoption**: Ensure clear documentation and intuitive user experience

## Implementation Strategy

### Clean Implementation Approach
1. **Fresh Start**: Build gRPC gaggle from scratch with modern patterns
2. **No Legacy Constraints**: Design optimal architecture without backwards compatibility burden
3. **Modern Configuration**: Design intuitive CLI and configuration system
4. **Performance First**: Focus on efficiency and scalability from day one

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits
- Restore distributed load testing capability for Goose users
- Enable users to upgrade from 0.16.4 to modern Goose versions
- Eliminate cmake build dependency issues

### Long-term Benefits  
- Industry-standard gRPC foundation enables future distributed features
- Improved maintainability through proven technology stack
- Enhanced performance and reliability over nng implementation
- Foundation for advanced features (auto-scaling, cloud integration)

## Next Steps

1. **Create Implementation Branch**: `feature/gaggle-grpc-implementation`
2. **Set up Development Environment**: Protocol buffer tooling, gRPC testing
3. **Begin Phase 1**: Start with protocol definition and basic service stubs
4. **Establish CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing for new gaggle components
5. **Performance Benchmarking Framework**: Baseline measurements for comparison
