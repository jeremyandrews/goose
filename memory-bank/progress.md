# Progress: Goose Load Testing Framework

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- **Basic Load Testing**: Creating and executing simple load tests
- **HTTP Requests**: GET, POST, HEAD, DELETE and other HTTP methods
- **Scenarios & Transactions**: Defining and executing user workflows
- **Metrics Collection**: Gathering and reporting performance data
- **User Simulation**: Spawning and managing simulated users
- **Session Management**: Maintaining state across requests
- **Weighted Selection**: Controlling frequency of scenarios and transactions
- **Request Throttling**: Limiting request rates to prevent overwhelming targets

### Advanced Features
- **Test Plans**: Complex load patterns with controlled scaling
- **Coordinated Omission Mitigation**: Statistical corrections for accurate metrics
- **Controllers**: Telnet and WebSocket interfaces for dynamic control
- **Scheduling Strategies**: Multiple algorithms for transaction execution
- **HTML Reports**: Graphical representation of test results
- **Transaction Sequencing**: Ordered execution of transactions
- **Custom Session Data**: Arbitrary user state management

### Client Capabilities
- **Cookie Management**: Automatic cookie handling across requests
- **Header Management**: Custom HTTP headers for requests
- **TLS Support**: Support for both native-tls and rustls
- **Custom Clients**: Ability to build custom Reqwest clients
- **Request Customization**: Timeouts, redirects, and other options

## What's In Development

Based on the codebase analysis, these features appear to be actively developed or recently implemented:

- **Gaggle Restoration**: Reimplementing distributed load testing functionality (currently disabled)
- **Enhanced Report Formats**: More comprehensive reporting options
- **Additional Controller Commands**: More granular runtime control
- **Custom Validation Helpers**: Simplifying response validation patterns
- **Example Expansion**: More demonstration scenarios for users

## Known Issues

Potential challenges identified from the code examination:

- **Gaggle Functionality Disabled**: Distributed load testing via Gaggle is currently disabled as of Goose 0.17.0
- **Resource Consumption**: High user counts require significant system resources
- **Complex Configuration**: Many options can lead to configuration challenges
- **Learning Curve**: Requires Rust knowledge for custom test scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Some error cases may have limited feedback
- **Documentation Gaps**: Some advanced features lack comprehensive examples

## Roadmap

Potential future enhancements based on code comments and design patterns:

- **Gaggle Implementation Options**:
  - **Hydro Integration**: Using Rust's distributed programming framework
  - **Zenoh Protocol**: Implementing Zero Overhead Network Protocol for efficiency
  - **gRPC/Tonic**: Leveraging Google's RPC system with Rust support
  - **Other Alternatives**: Exploring Cap'n Proto or Tarpc as potential solutions
- **Enhanced UI Integration**: Better web-based control interfaces
- **Additional Metrics Exporters**: Support for more metrics storage systems
- **Advanced Rate Shaping**: More sophisticated traffic patterns
- **Improved Validation**: Built-in assertions and validation helpers
- **Additional Protocol Support**: Beyond HTTP/HTTPS
- **Enhanced Test Plan Visualization**: Better graphical representation of planned load
- **Configuration Profiles**: Saved configurations for different testing scenarios
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Anomaly detection in performance metrics
- **AI-Assisted Code Reviews**: 
  - âœ“ GooseBot Phase 1 implemented (PR clarity reviews)
    - GitHub Actions workflow ready
    - Python script integrates with Anthropic API
    - Templates for clarity reviews optimized for maximum brevity
    - Provides "no issues found" response when documentation is adequate
    - Initial testing successful with ultra-concise output format
  - Phase 2 planned (code quality and style)
  - Phase 3 planned (specialized multi-agent reviews)
  - Phase 4 planned (refinement and optional enforcement)
