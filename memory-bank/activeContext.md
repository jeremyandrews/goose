# Active Context: Goose Load Testing Framework

## Current Work Focus
The current focus of the Goose project is on implementing the new **Gaggle distributed testing** feature using gRPC. The main development effort is progressing through the multi-phase implementation plan outlined in the gaggle-grpc-implementation-plan.md.

**Current Phase: Phase 3 - Integration with Existing Goose**

Recent development has focused on:
- Gaggle gRPC infrastructure (Phase 1 & 2 complete)
- Core distributed testing logic implementation
- Integration preparation with main Goose configuration system

## Recent Changes
**Gaggle Implementation Progress:**

- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete**: Foundation and Protocol Definition
  - Protocol buffer definitions (`proto/gaggle.proto`)
  - gRPC service generation with `tonic-prost-build`
  - Feature-gated gaggle functionality
  - Build script infrastructure

- ✅ **Phase 2 Complete**: Core Gaggle Logic Implementation  
  - Manager service implementation (`src/gaggle/manager.rs`)
  - Worker client implementation (`src/gaggle/worker.rs`)
  - Configuration system (`src/gaggle/config.rs`)
  - gRPC communication infrastructure
  - **Fixed compilation issues**: Resolved `tonic-prost-build` dependency configuration

- **Fixed Recent Build Issues (December 2024)**:
  - Corrected `Cargo.toml` gaggle feature dependencies
  - Fixed `build.rs` tonic-prost-build integration
  - Removed unused imports causing warnings
  - Achieved clean compilation with `cargo check --features gaggle`

## Next Steps
**Phase 3: Integration with Existing Goose** - Ready to begin:

1. **GooseConfiguration Extensions**:
   - Add gaggle CLI flags (`--manager`, `--worker`, `--manager-host`, etc.)
   - Integrate `GaggleConfiguration` with main config system
   - Feature-gated configuration options

2. **GooseAttack Integration**:
   - Implement `execute_gaggle_manager()` method
   - Implement `execute_gaggle_worker()` method  
   - Modify main `execute()` with automatic mode detection

3. **CLI Integration**:
   - Manager/worker mode flags
   - Connection configuration options
   - Worker management commands

**Future Phases Ready for Implementation:**
- Phase 4: Advanced Features and Reliability
- Phase 5: Testing and Validation  
- Phase 6: Documentation and Migration
- Phase 7: Controller Integration
- Enhancing the report generation capabilities and visualizations
- Expanding controller functionality for more granular test control
- Improving documentation and examples for advanced features
- Adding more sophisticated transaction validation capabilities
- Developing additional tools for test result analysis
- **AI-Assisted Code Reviews**: 
  - Completed implementation of GooseBot Phase 1 for automated PR clarity reviews; initial testing successful
  - Improved GooseBot output format to be extremely concise, focused only on essential issues
  - Enhanced prompts to provide conceptual suggestions that explain the value of changes
  - Refined Markdown formatting for better compatibility with GitHub's renderer
  - Added guidance to build upon existing descriptions rather than replacing them
  - Created local testing tool with .env support for faster prompt iteration
  - Added explicit "no issues found" response when PR documentation is adequate
  - Additional review scopes planned for future phases (see [aiCodeReviewPlan.md](./aiCodeReviewPlan.md) for full implementation plan)
  - ✓ Updated Claude model from deprecated claude-3-sonnet-20240229 to claude-sonnet-4-20250514 (Issue #623)
  - ✓ **Completed comprehensive code review of PR #617**: Standardized logging format across entire codebase with consistent module prefixes (`[config]:`, `[controller]:`, `[logger]:`, `[metrics]:`, `[throttle]:`, `[user]:`), fixed documentation build failures, verified all tests pass, confirmed real-world functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Async Model**: Using Tokio for asynchronous execution provides efficient resource usage but requires careful error handling
- **Metrics Collection**: Balancing detailed metrics collection against performance overhead
- **Controller Interfaces**: Providing multiple interface options (telnet/WebSocket) for flexibility
- **Gaggle Replacement**: Evaluating distributed systems technologies (Hydro, Zenoh, gRPC/Tonic) to replace the previous nng-based implementation

### Design Considerations
- **API Usability**: Maintaining a clear and intuitive API despite complex internal mechanics
- **Performance Impact**: Ensuring the load testing tool itself has minimal impact on measurements
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Balancing command-line options, defaults, and programmatic configuration
- **Error Handling**: Providing meaningful feedback about test execution problems

### Implementation Challenges
- **Coordinated Omission**: Statistical challenges in representing "missing" requests
- **Resource Management**: Efficiently managing thousands of simulated users
- **Test Reproducibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across test runs
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Supporting various operating systems and environments
