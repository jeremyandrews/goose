# Active Context: Goose Load Testing Framework

## Current Work Focus
The current focus of the Goose project appears to be on stabilizing and enhancing its core load testing capabilities. Based on the source code examination, the following areas are in active development:

- Coordinated Omission Mitigation for more accurate performance metrics
- Advanced reporting capabilities with HTML reports and graphs
- Controller interfaces for dynamic test adjustment
- Session state management to support complex user flows

## Recent Changes
From examining the codebase, recent developments include:

- Implementation of sophisticated test plans for complex load patterns
- Telnet and WebSocket controllers for runtime test management
- Session data capabilities for maintaining state across requests
- Enhanced metrics collection with coordinated omission mitigation
- Multiple scheduler strategies for different load testing scenarios

## Next Steps
Based on the code analysis, potential next steps for the project may include:

- **Restoring Gaggle Functionality**: Reimplementing distributed load testing capabilities that were removed in v0.17.0
- Enhancing the report generation capabilities and visualizations
- Expanding controller functionality for more granular test control
- Improving documentation and examples for advanced features
- Adding more sophisticated transaction validation capabilities
- Developing additional tools for test result analysis
  - **AI-Assisted Code Reviews**: 
  - Completed implementation of GooseBot Phase 1 for automated PR clarity reviews; initial testing successful
  - Improved GooseBot output format to be extremely concise, focused only on essential issues
  - Enhanced prompts to provide conceptual suggestions that explain the value of changes
  - Refined Markdown formatting for better compatibility with GitHub's renderer
  - Added guidance to build upon existing descriptions rather than replacing them
  - Created local testing tool with .env support for faster prompt iteration
  - Added explicit "no issues found" response when PR documentation is adequate
  - Implemented smart change detection to reduce redundant comments:
    - MD5 hash tracking of PR title/description for efficient change detection
    - Suggestion comparison logic to avoid duplicate feedback
    - Force review option for manual override when needed
    - Enhanced local testing tool with diagnostic information about changes
  - Implemented GooseBot Phase 2 for code quality and style reviews:
    - Created quality review prompt template focusing on Rust best practices
    - Added support for extracting PR diff content for analysis
    - Implemented automatic chunking for large diffs
    - Developed JSON-based structured response format for categorized feedback:
      - Standardized output schema with category, description, suggestion, and impact fields
      - Comprehensive error handling for malformed JSON responses
      - Fallback parsing mechanisms for handling LLM output variations
      - Special handling for empty response cases (e.g., typo fix PRs)
    - Added suggestion formatting with category, description, and impact
    - Enhanced test script for local testing without GitHub dependencies
    - Fixed JSON parsing issues in Claude's responses:
      - Added detection and repair of malformed JSON patterns (specifically `{,` syntax)
      - Enhanced system prompt to encourage proper JSON formatting
      - Implemented more robust error handling for better diagnostics 
      - Improved parsing robustness to handle subtle formatting variations
    - Added inline PR review comments support:
      - Updated quality review prompt to include file path and line number information
      - Implemented position mapping between file lines and diff positions
      - Created draft review comment functionality on specific lines of code
      - Added suggestion formatting using GitHub's suggestion syntax
      - Enhanced error handling with fallback to general comments when lines can't be mapped
      - Updated test script to support testing inline comments functionality
    - Improved string formatting robustness:
      - Created a safe template formatter that avoids Python string formatting issues
      - Replaced Python's `.format()` method with direct string replacement
      - Added proper error handling for template processing
      - Fixed issues with curly braces in JSON examples
      - Improved error reporting with better context
      - Added consistent default values for missing fields
    - Enhanced JSON parsing and formatting:
      - Added recursive JSON extraction function to handle nested JSON structures
      - Implemented proper validation of suggestion objects
      - Added more descriptive context for error entries
      - Improved formatting of issues with unknown locations
      - Fixed issue with raw JSON appearing in comment output
      - Added better fallback handling for partial parsing
    - Created comprehensive documentation explaining the JSON structure integration
  - Additional review scopes planned for future phases (see [aiCodeReviewPlan.md](./aiCodeReviewPlan.md) for full implementation plan)
  - Update Claude model before July 2025 deprecation date

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Async Model**: Using Tokio for asynchronous execution provides efficient resource usage but requires careful error handling
- **Metrics Collection**: Balancing detailed metrics collection against performance overhead
- **Controller Interfaces**: Providing multiple interface options (telnet/WebSocket) for flexibility
- **Gaggle Replacement**: Evaluating distributed systems technologies (Hydro, Zenoh, gRPC/Tonic) to replace the previous nng-based implementation

### Design Considerations
- **API Usability**: Maintaining a clear and intuitive API despite complex internal mechanics
- **Performance Impact**: Ensuring the load testing tool itself has minimal impact on measurements
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Balancing command-line options, defaults, and programmatic configuration
- **Error Handling**: Providing meaningful feedback about test execution problems

### Implementation Challenges
- **Coordinated Omission**: Statistical challenges in representing "missing" requests
- **Resource Management**: Efficiently managing thousands of simulated users
- **Test Reproducibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across test runs
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Supporting various operating systems and environments
