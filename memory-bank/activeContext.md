# Active Context: Goose Load Testing Framework

## Current Work Focus
The current focus of the Goose project appears to be on stabilizing and enhancing its core load testing capabilities. Based on the source code examination, the following areas are in active development:

- Coordinated Omission Mitigation for more accurate performance metrics
- Advanced reporting capabilities with HTML reports and graphs
- Controller interfaces for dynamic test adjustment
- Session state management to support complex user flows

## Recent Changes
From examining the codebase, recent developments include:

- Implementation of sophisticated test plans for complex load patterns
- Telnet and WebSocket controllers for runtime test management
- Session data capabilities for maintaining state across requests
- Enhanced metrics collection with coordinated omission mitigation
- Multiple scheduler strategies for different load testing scenarios

## Next Steps
Based on the code analysis, potential next steps for the project may include:

- **Restoring Gaggle Functionality**: Reimplementing distributed load testing capabilities that were removed in v0.17.0
- Enhancing the report generation capabilities and visualizations
- Expanding controller functionality for more granular test control
- Improving documentation and examples for advanced features
- Adding more sophisticated transaction validation capabilities
- Developing additional tools for test result analysis
- **AI-Assisted Code Reviews**: 
  - Completed implementation of GooseBot Phase 1 for automated PR clarity reviews; initial testing successful
  - Improved GooseBot output format to be extremely concise, focused only on essential issues
  - Added explicit "no issues found" response when PR documentation is adequate
  - Additional review scopes planned for future phases (see [aiCodeReviewPlan.md](./aiCodeReviewPlan.md) for full implementation plan)
  - Update Claude model before July 2025 deprecation date

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Async Model**: Using Tokio for asynchronous execution provides efficient resource usage but requires careful error handling
- **Metrics Collection**: Balancing detailed metrics collection against performance overhead
- **Controller Interfaces**: Providing multiple interface options (telnet/WebSocket) for flexibility
- **Gaggle Replacement**: Evaluating distributed systems technologies (Hydro, Zenoh, gRPC/Tonic) to replace the previous nng-based implementation

### Design Considerations
- **API Usability**: Maintaining a clear and intuitive API despite complex internal mechanics
- **Performance Impact**: Ensuring the load testing tool itself has minimal impact on measurements
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Balancing command-line options, defaults, and programmatic configuration
- **Error Handling**: Providing meaningful feedback about test execution problems

### Implementation Challenges
- **Coordinated Omission**: Statistical challenges in representing "missing" requests
- **Resource Management**: Efficiently managing thousands of simulated users
- **Test Reproducibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across test runs
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Supporting various operating systems and environments
