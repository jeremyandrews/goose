# Active Context - Goose Load Testing Framework

## Current Status
Working on fixing test failures and warnings after successful git rebase of baseline-feature-v2 branch against upstream/main.

## Test Results After Rebase
- ✅ 48 unit tests PASSED
- ✅ 90 documentation tests PASSED  
- ✅ Most integration tests PASSED
- ⚠️ 1 test failure: `test_pdf_print_html_without_feature_works` (PDF feature test)
- ⚠️ 2 dead code warnings for unused PDF print functions

## Current Issue Analysis
The failing test `test_pdf_print_html_without_feature_works` expects `--pdf-print-html` functionality to work without the pdf-reports feature flag. The test failure suggests this functionality may have been lost during the rebase process.

## User Guidance
User clarified that we should NOT create new PDF functionality. Instead, we should:
1. Compare against upstream/main to understand what was lost in rebase
2. Restore missing functionality rather than creating new code
3. Use --no-pager commands to avoid hanging
4. Manage context window better (compress when >60% full)

## Next Steps
1. Run git diff against upstream/main to identify missing PDF functionality
2. Restore any lost PDF print functionality
3. Fix the failing test and dead code warnings
4. Ensure baseline functionality tests are comprehensive

## Files Currently Under Investigation
- `src/metrics.rs` - Main metrics file where PDF functionality integration occurs
- `src/report/print.rs` - Contains PDF print functions with dead code warnings
- `tests/pdf_reports.rs` - Contains the failing test
- `tests/baseline.rs` - Contains 11 baseline tests (all passing)
