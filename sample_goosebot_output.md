### GooseBot PR Clarity Review

**Title lacks specificity** → Change "goosebot improvements" to "Improve GooseBot PR clarity review formatting and actionability"

**PR description too brief** → Add context about the changes: "This PR updates the GooseBot review prompt to generate more concise, actionable feedback. It changes the output format to focus on specific recommendations rather than general observations."

**Documentation files need explanation** → Add inline comments in activeContext.md and progress.md explaining how the GooseBot improvements relate to the current project phase.
